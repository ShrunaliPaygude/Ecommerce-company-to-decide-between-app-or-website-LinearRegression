# Ecommerce-company-to-decide-between-app-or-website-LinearRegression

There is a clothing company having a retail shop as well as online shoping website. We have to help them decide whether to improve their mobile app experience or their website to maximise the profit. Lets help them out!

I have used Linear regression for the purpose and did a detailed EDA and various visualizations for better understanding. At the end, inferring from the results obtained is done which will help us to take a decision for improving the business.
